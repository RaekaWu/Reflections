When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
My answer: When I work with others on one repository and we will make difference changes at the same time, 
I need to create a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
My answer: Pulling changes manually can let me decide when and how to fetch my willing branch.
