When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
My answer: When I work with others on one repository and we will make difference changes at the same time, 
I need to create a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
My answer: Pulling changes manually can let me decide when and how to fetch my willing branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
My answer: Forks can just be used in GitHub. For example, I don't have permission to Henry's repository A, so I can fork A in my account on GitHub. Clones can be used in any two repositories, such as from local to local, from GitHub to local. Branches can be used in a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
My answer: It can keep both the latest commit in local and in remote on local repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
My answer: Harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
My answer: When I want to do some changes but they aren't confirmed by others, I can make changes in a separate branch rather than in master.
